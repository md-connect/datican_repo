# Brain MRI Dataset - Brain Atrophy vs Normal  
  
## Overview  
  
The DATICAN Medical Image Repository provides a curated collection of anonymized medical imaging data intended for machine learning research, medical image analysis, and clinical imaging studies. All data have been prepared in compliance with accepted clinical data management and research ethics standards.  
  
## Dataset Description  
  
This repository contains Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data in DICOM (.dcm) format.  
  
- **Total images**: 500 Brain MRI scans  
- **Classes**:  
  - 250 Brain Atrophy cases  
  - 250 Normal (control) cases  
- **Imaging modality**: MRI  
- **File format**: DICOM (.dcm)  
- **Labels**: Diagnostic labels provided in accompanying CSV files  
- **Total size**: ~500 GB (raw DICOM volumes)  
- **Viewer**: User requires to install any DICOM viewer in order to preview the dataset (e.g., Radiant, MRICro, Weasis, etc.)  
  
Each MRI scan represents a unique study and is associated with a diagnostic label.  
  
## Data Anonymization  
  
All images have been fully de-identified prior to inclusion. Patient-identifiable metadata were removed or anonymized in accordance with DICOM de-identification standards and institutional ethical guidelines.
